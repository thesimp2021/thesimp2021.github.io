my perfect future of apps is entirely made by webz
i had a lot of fun doing math and computer problems, this is my love letter written fully in javascript,
the only language that im willing to worship just like my gf
my dram comes true making game, minimalist look but looking super modern
i hate frontend programming, but i manage to go through it, code deployment, project setup
this app is inspired by derekdelgaudio, identity "the rook/mechanic", the 5 thumbnail level display, rouletista
