my perfect future of apps is entirely made by web

i had a lot of fun doing math and computer problems, this is my love letter written fully in javascript,
the only language that im willing to worship just like my gf


movie tix -> coffee -> cam ->  cdg -> netflix acc

semarang (cinema) -> bangkok (coffee/restaurant) -> serbia(good picx, city views) -> bandung (puncak) -> bed netflix and chill
temen2 undip -> debating friends -> another temen2 debate -> temen2 jauh -> iqi

i hate frontend programming, but i manage to go through it, code deployment, project setup

this app is inspired by derekdelgaudio, identity "the rook/mechanic", the 5 thumbnail level display, rouletista
